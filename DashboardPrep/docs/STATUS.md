# Golf Analytics Pro - Repository Status

## High-Level Summary

The Prepare workflow currently provides end-to-end course analysis: users can select curated courses, import OSM data to generate 3D vector overlays and raster masks, navigate between holes with proper tee/green endpoint detection, and run dispersion analysis with colored sample visualization. The system includes camera automation, real-time terrain height sampling, elevation-aware "plays like" distance calculations, and ES (Expected Strokes) evaluation with live sample classification counts. All data is processed in-memory (no persistence), and the app runs as a single full-stack application combining React/Cesium frontend with Express backend.

## Architecture Map

### Server/API
- **server/index.ts**: Express server entry point with session middleware, port 8080
- **server/routes.ts**: API endpoints for courses, holes, user polygons, and `/api/courses/import-osm`
- **server/storage.ts**: In-memory storage layer (courses, holes, user polygons)
- **server/vite.ts**: Vite dev server integration for development mode

Import endpoint `/api/courses/import-osm` accepts `{seeds: string[]}` and returns `ImportResponse` with course bbox, hole polylines, and categorized feature collections.

### OSM/Overpass Import
- **shared/overpass.ts**: `OverpassImporter` class fetches course data from OSM relations
- Categorizes features: greens (polygons), fairways (polygons), bunkers (golf=bunker + surface=sand), water (natural=water + golf hazards), tees (nodes/polygons)
- Returns hole polylines with ref numbers, par, and distance when available
- Used by: server routes, dashboard course loading

### Raster/Mask
- **client/src/lib/maskPainter.ts**: `createMaskFromFeatures()` converts GeoJSON to canvas raster
- **client/src/lib/maskBuffer.ts**: Bbox expansion, aspect ratio preservation, class mapping utilities
- **client/src/lib/rasterOverlay.ts**: Cesium terrain overlay rendering with depth settings
- Class mapping: 0=unknown, 2=water, 4=bunker, 5=green, 6=fairway, 7=recovery, 8=rough, 9=tee
- 4096x512 max resolution with aspect ratio preservation, imageSmoothing disabled

### Vector Feature Layers

### Hole Navigation
- **client/src/components/prepare/HoleNavigator.tsx**: Hole selection, camera view buttons, auto-navigation
- **client/src/lib/holeGeom.ts**: `assignEndpoints()` determines tee/green from polyline proximity, geodesic calculations, bearing math
- Custom camera formula: `hole_offset = (holeLen ** 0.87) * 0.7 + 50`, positioned behind tee with proper heading
- Used by: dashboard for hole switching, camera positioning

### Sampling/Dispersion
- **client/src/components/prepare/SamplesLayer.ts**: Point primitive collection for sample visualization
- **client/src/lib/sampling.ts**: `generateEllipseSamples()` for uniform ellipse sampling
- **client/src/prepare/lib/ellipse.ts**: Ellipse geometry and sampling algorithms
- 1200 default capacity, async height refinement with +0.05m lift, color-coded by class
- Used by: DispersionInspector, ES workers

### Expected Strokes

- **client/src/components/prepare/DispersionInspector.tsx**: ES worker integration, sample generation

## Current Behavior

### Course Import Path
1. User selects curated course from `public/curated.json`
2. `/api/courses/import-osm` called with OSM relation seeds
3. `OverpassImporter.importCourse()` fetches relation data, extracts hole ways, categorizes features
4. Returns `ImportResponse`: course (id, name, bbox), holes (ref, polyline positions), features (greens, fairways, bunkers, water, tees as GeoJSON FeatureCollections)
5. Client creates mask via `createMaskFromFeatures()`, stores hole polylines by ref Map

### Hole Navigation
1. Click hole number → `handleHoleNavigation()` with custom camera formula
2. Finds polyline by ref, runs `assignEndpoints()` to determine tee/green from proximity
3. Sets start/aim/pin points, flies camera behind tee with `hole_offset` calculation
4. Camera views (Tee/Fairway/Green buttons) use same endpoints for consistent bearings
5. Animation: 0.5s duration, heading from tee→green, pitch based on hole length

### Dispersion Samples
1. Generated via `generateEllipseSamples()` with uniform distribution inside ellipse
2. 1200 sample capacity, initially placed at ground level + 0.05m
3. Async batch refinement via `CesiumHeightProvider.sampleHeightsAsync()`
4. Colored by class ID: 6=limegreen (fairway), 5=lightgreen (green), 2=cornflowerblue (water), etc.
5. Real-time classification via mask pixel sampling

### Raster Overlay
1. Built from GeoJSON features via canvas painting: fairway→green→bunker→water→tee order
2. 4096x512 max resolution, bbox expanded by 0.01°, aspect ratio preserved
3. Rendered as Cesium ImageryLayer with imageSmoothing disabled
4. Depth testing disabled to prevent terrain occlusion
5. Toggle modes: off, fill (0.8 opacity), edges (1.0 opacity)

### What's Not Wired
- Optimizer panel (CEM algorithm) - UI exists but worker not implemented
- Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles - toggle exists but integration not complete
- User polygon drawing - storage routes exist but UI not connected
- Slope arrows around greens - planned but not implemented
- Course persistence - all data is in-memory only

## Raster Class Map

```javascript
// Class ID → Color/Condition mapping (as implemented)
0: UNKNOWN/ROUGH → olive (treated as rough in ES calculations)
1: OB → whitesmoke (+2 strokes penalty in ES)
2: WATER → cornflowerblue (+1 stroke penalty)
3: HAZARD → tomato (+1 stroke penalty)
4: BUNKER → peachpuff (+0.5 strokes penalty)
5: GREEN → lightgreen (putting calculations)
6: FAIRWAY → limegreen (baseline condition)
7: RECOVERY → plum (+0.25 strokes penalty)
8: ROUGH → olive (+0.25 strokes penalty)
9: TEE → powderblue (treated as fairway)
```

Paint order (later overwrites earlier): fairway → green → bunker → water → tee
Special rules: hazard=rough+1, OB=rough+2, water/bunker based on ES engine polynomials

## Developer How-To

### Run/Dev
```bash
npm run dev    # Development server (frontend + backend) → localhost:8080
npm run build  # Production build (client + server bundle)
npm start      # Run production build
npm run check  # TypeScript type checking
npm run db:push # Push database schema (Drizzle Kit)
```

### Environment
- Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles API key: Set `VITE_CESIUM_ION_ACCESS_TOKEN` (partially wired)
- Development runs on port 8080, production respects `PORT` env var
- No other external API keys required for current functionality

### Testing a Course
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to localhost:8080
3. Click "Select Course" → choose "St Andrews Links" or other curated course
4. Wait for import progress (OSM fetch → feature processing → mask creation)
5. Navigate holes using grid or Prev/Next buttons
6. Click "Tee/Fairway/Green" camera views to test navigation
7. Run dispersion analysis in right panel to see colored samples
8. Verify landing conditions show real percentages/counts from samples

## Immediate TODOs (P0)

### ☐ Implement optimizer (CEM) replacing ring grid
**Files**: `client/src/workers/optimizerWorker.ts` (exists but not implemented), hook from `OptimizerPanel.tsx`
Use progressive Monte Carlo ES with CI early-stop; use raster classes + expected-strokes for evaluation; use baked elevation (when available) for plays-like; return top K candidates with min spatial separation.

### ☐ Implement Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles  
**Files**: Add API key plumbing to `CesiumCanvas.tsx`, create UI toggle in `VectorLayerPanel.tsx`
Load tileset in CesiumCanvas.tsx; ensure depth ordering so vectors/samples remain visible over photorealistic terrain.

### ☐ Implement user polygons & conversion into mask
**Files**: Create drawing UI in new component, wire to existing storage routes in `server/routes.ts`
Drawing UI with classification palette, saving to storage; rasterization via `maskPainter.ts` path that aligns exactly with mask bbox/resolution; merge with OSM polygons.

### ☐ Implement course condition counts from sampled points
**Files**: Update `ShotMetrics.tsx` and `MetricsBar.tsx` to show detailed breakdowns
From each ES run, compute per-class counts/histograms and show in Shot Metrics (in-play vs. penalty classes separately). Currently shows basic counts but needs histogram visualization.

### ☐ Implement Expected Strokes (real engine)
**Files**: Verify `shared/expected-strokes.js` integration in `client/src/workers/esWorker.ts`
Ensure adapter is called for every sample; wire CI ± display in Shot Metrics; remove any simplified placeholders in favor of full polynomial calculations.

### ☐ Implement Advanced Short Game  
**Files**: Extend `expectedStrokesAdapter.ts`, add toggle in `AimPanel.tsx`
Within 45 yds: slope, green-available, up/downhill, toward/away modifiers; integrate in adapter and surface toggle in UI.

### ☐ Implement slope arrows around greens
**Files**: New component for arrow rendering, integrate into `CesiumCanvas.tsx`
Use prebaked elevation fine grid around greens; compute local gradient; render arrow glyphs with controllable density, magnitude scaling, and an on/off toggle.

## Near-Term (P1)

### ☐ Prebaked elevation grid (coarse + fine patches around greens)
**Files**: `client/src/lib/elevationBake.ts` (exists), worker integration
Aligned to raster bbox; bilinear sampling and feathering; worker transfer for large grids.

### ☐ Persist baked grids per hole (IndexedDB)  
Avoid re-bake on subsequent hole visits; cache management with size limits.

### ☐ Robust error messages for missing features
Handle no hole polylines, missing tees/greens gracefully; Overpass fallbacks for incomplete data.

## Open Issues / Known Gaps

### Console Warnings
- `ositogeojson` CJS/ESM import warnings in `shared/overpass.ts:3` - resolved with fallback pattern
- Missing terrain provider warnings when Cesium viewer initializes without Ion token
- Point elevation validation warnings when points change faster than async sampling

### Raster Alignment
- Mask bbox expansion by 0.01° may cause slight misalignment with very small courses
- Canvas painting order occasionally shows edge artifacts between adjacent polygons
- High-resolution masks (4096px) may cause memory pressure on lower-end devices

### Unhandled Promise Rejections
- Terrain sampling failures in `heightProvider.ts` are caught but not surfaced to UI
- ES worker termination edge cases when multiple calculations overlap

## API Shapes

### /api/courses/import-osm Response
```typescript
interface ImportResponse {
  course: { 
    id: string;           // "standrews-old-course"
    name: string;         // "St Andrews Old Course"
    bbox: { west: number; south: number; east: number; north: number }
  };
  holes: Array<{
    ref: string;          // "1", "2", ..., "18"
    polyline: { 
      positions: {lon: number; lat: number}[];
      par?: number;       // extracted from tags
      dist?: number;      // distance in yards if available
    };
  }>;
  features: {
    greens: GeoJSON.FeatureCollection;    // Polygon geometries only
    fairways: GeoJSON.FeatureCollection;  // Polygon geometries only

    water: GeoJSON.FeatureCollection;     // Polygon geometries only
    tees: GeoJSON.FeatureCollection;      // Point/Polygon geometries
  };
}
```

### Internal Structures
